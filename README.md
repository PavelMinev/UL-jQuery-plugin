# UL-jQuery-plugin
This plugin allows you to get the weather for first city in each list item from your target 'ul'. The information appends to the end of the 'li' element. Also this plugin adds some animation to the ul elements: clicking the 'li' element leads to the relocation of target element to the begining of the 'ul' (if 'direction' is 'up' [by default]) or to the end of the 'ul' (if 'direction' is 'down'). You can rewrite default cities in plugin ("Saint-Petersburg","Moscow","London","Paris", "Tallin", "Helsinki", "Berlin", "Rome") - call $('ul').weatherLi("city" : ["City1", "City2", ... , "CityN"].)
